# Activity: Variables and Simple Data Types

## Introduction

Let's get hands-on experience with these exercises to enhance our understanding of variables and simple data types in Python.

### Starter Files

Participants should start a new Jupyter Notebook for this activity.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, we'll be able to:

1. Declare and initialize variables using diverse data types.
2. Understand and leverage the concepts of mutability and immutability in Python.
3. Utilize the `type()` function to discern the data type of variables.

## Activity Walkthrough

### Task 1: Engaging with Variables and Simple Data Types

**Creating and Displaying Variables**: Let's begin our exploration by creating variables of different data types. We'll see how Python handles integers, floats, strings, and boolean values.

**Step 1. Create and Display Variables:** First, we'll define variables of various data types and print them to observe how they are represented in Python.

```python
# Creating variables
our_integer = 10
our_float = 20.5
our_string = "Hello, Python!"
our_bool = True
print(our_integer, our_float, our_string, our_bool)
